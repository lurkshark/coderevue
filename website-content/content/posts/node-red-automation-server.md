[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is a great tool for automating busywork but it can get expensive quickly. Billing is based on the number of steps in a workflow that get executed, so adding just a few extra tasks like parsing or formatting text can inflate your costs. [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is an open-source project for low-code event-driven programming, very similar to Zapier but a bit more technical. It's built on NodeJS and allows you to define automation flows with [pre-made](https://flows.nodered.org/search?type=node&sort=downloads) or [custom-made](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/) nodes as well as [inline JavaScript functions](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/writing-functions).

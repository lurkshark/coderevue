[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is a great tool for automating busywork but it can get expensive quickly. Billing is based on the number of steps in a workflow that get executed, so adding just a few extra tasks like parsing or formatting text can inflate your costs. [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is an open-source project for low-code event-driven programming, very similar to Zapier but a bit more technical. It's built on NodeJS and allows you to define automation flows with [pre-made](https://flows.nodered.org/search?type=node&sort=downloads) or [custom-made](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/) nodes as well as [inline JavaScript functions](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/writing-functions).

Node-RED is usually mentioned in the context of connected devices and home automation because that's the use-case that the project was originally built for, but with all the functionality that has been added over the years it's grown to be capable of almost any workflow you could want. This makes it a great candidate as an open-source alternative to Zapier.
